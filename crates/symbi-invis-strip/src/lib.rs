//! Strip invisible / steganographic Unicode code points and
//! renderer-hidden markup from strings.
//!
//! This crate extracts the [`sanitize_field`] helper used by the
//! `symbiont-karpathy-loop` demo's knowledge store, packaged as a
//! standalone zero-dep library for reuse by other agent frameworks
//! that write user-influenced strings into long-term memory.
//!
//! Two entry points:
//!
//! - [`sanitize_field`] — strips Unicode-level invisibles only.
//!   Conservative; safe to apply to any free-text field.
//! - [`sanitize_field_with_markup`] — also strips `<!-- ... -->`
//!   HTML comments and triple-backtick fenced blocks. Right for
//!   short structured fields (knowledge-store triples, journal
//!   entries) where these have no legitimate use; defends against
//!   the 2026 GitHub-comment prompt-injection family (multiple
//!   agent frameworks parsed Markdown-renderer-hidden payloads from
//!   agent context) and the same trick using "just example code"
//!   fenced blocks.
//!
//! ## Why it exists
//!
//! LLM agents that write to a knowledge store are a ready channel for
//! prompt injection and payload smuggling. An attacker-controlled
//! reflector or a confused planner can emit a seemingly-innocent
//! triple whose `object` field contains zero-width characters, bidi
//! overrides, the Unicode Tag block, ASCII C0 controls, or any of the
//! other canonical steganographic channels. Those payloads survive
//! round-trip into storage and resurface when the next agent reads the
//! store — at which point the knowledge-store content becomes an
//! instruction surface.
//!
//! The fix is straightforward and content-agnostic: drop every
//! code point that has no legitimate textual use, before it lands.
//! That's what [`sanitize_field`] does.
//!
//! ## Forbidden ranges
//!
//! - `U+0000..=U+0008`, `U+000B..=U+000C`, `U+000E..=U+001F`, `U+007F`
//!   — ASCII C0 controls and DEL (excluding `\t`, `\n`, `\r`).
//! - `U+0080..=U+009F` — C1 control block.
//! - `U+200B..=U+200F` — zero-width + LRM/RLM.
//! - `U+202A..=U+202E` — bidi explicit directional overrides.
//! - `U+2060..=U+206F` — word joiner, invisible operators, bidi
//!   isolates, deprecated format controls.
//! - `U+FEFF` — BOM / ZWNBSP.
//! - `U+180E` — Mongolian vowel separator (legacy invisible).
//! - `U+1D173..=U+1D17A` — musical notation invisible format chars.
//! - `U+FE00..=U+FE0F` — variation selectors (emoji-VS steg).
//! - `U+E0100..=U+E01EF` — supplementary variation selectors.
//! - `U+E0000..=U+E007F` — Unicode Tag block (primary steg channel
//!   for "invisible text").
//! - `U+00AD` — soft hyphen (invisible word breaker, used to defeat
//!   substring marker detection).
//! - `U+0300..=U+036F` — combining diacritical marks (attach to
//!   letters, steganographic mangling of substring matchers).
//! - `U+2070..=U+209F` — superscript / subscript forms (visual
//!   lookalike bypass for substring matchers).
//!
//! Legitimate printable content — ASCII, CJK, Cyrillic, diacritics,
//! emoji proper, regular whitespace (`\t`, `\n`, `\r`) — survives
//! unchanged.
//!
//! ## Minimal example
//!
//! ```
//! use symbi_invis_strip::sanitize_field;
//!
//! // Zero-width space smuggled between two words:
//! assert_eq!(sanitize_field("store\u{200B}knowledge"), "storeknowledge");
//!
//! // Multilingual content roundtrips:
//! assert_eq!(sanitize_field("Привет 世界"), "Привет 世界");
//! ```
//!
//! ## Minimal dependencies, `no_std`-compatible core
//!
//! The crate has one small dependency (`unicode-normalization`, used
//! by [`detect_injection_patterns`] to NFKC-normalise input before
//! marker matching — this closes the fullwidth and math-alphanumeric
//! homoglyph bypass classes). The core strip surface
//! ([`sanitize_field`], [`is_forbidden`]) still uses only
//! `core`-equivalent operations.
//!
//! ## Sync point
//!
//! The forbidden-range list is also mirrored in two Python scripts in
//! the upstream repo:
//! `scripts/audit-knowledge-stores.py` (post-sweep DB scanner) and
//! `scripts/lint-cedar-policies.py` (Cedar-file linter). Drift between
//! this table and those scripts is a bug; update all three together.
