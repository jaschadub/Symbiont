**Policy-governed agent runtime for production.**
*Same agent. Secure runtime.*

![A Cedar policy denies a live agent's privileged tool call](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThirdKeyAI/Symbiont/main/docs/media/cedar-demo.gif)

> **What you're seeing:** a real model (`claude-haiku-4.5`) asks to list the agent fleet. A Cedar `forbid` rule denies the call on **every retry** — no code change, just policy. [Reproduce it in one command ↓](#see-the-policy-gate-deny-a-tool--one-command-no-setup) · [▶ Full walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPyKpqKz5ik)

Symbiont is a Rust-native runtime for executing AI agents and tools under explicit policy, identity, and audit controls.

> **Containment:** See the [operator guide](docs/containment-branch-guide.md)
> for the CLI, TUI, chat, audit and scheduling changes in 1.21.0.
> It includes migration steps and the remaining gaps; full containment across all
> entry points is not established.

Most agent frameworks focus on orchestration. Symbiont focuses on what happens when agents need to run in real environments with real risk: untrusted tools, sensitive data, approval boundaries, audit requirements, and repeatable enforcement.

---

## Why Symbiont

AI agents are easy to demo and hard to trust.

Once an agent can call tools, access files, send messages, or invoke external services, you need more than prompts and glue code. You need:

* **Policy enforcement** for what an agent may do — built-in DSL and [Cedar](https://www.cedarpolicy.com/) authorization
* **Tool verification** so execution is not blind trust — [SchemaPin](https://github.com/ThirdKeyAI/SchemaPin) cryptographic verification of MCP tools
* **Tool contracts** for how tools execute — [ToolClad](https://github.com/ThirdKeyAI/ToolClad) declarative input validation, scope enforcement, and injection prevention
* **Agent identity** so you know who is acting — [AgentPin](https://github.com/ThirdKeyAI/AgentPin) domain-anchored ES256 identity
* **Sandboxing** for risky workloads — choose Docker, gVisor (`runsc`), or Firecracker microVM per agent
* **Audit trails** for what happened and why — cryptographically tamper-evident logs
* **Approval gates** for sensitive actions — human review before execution when policy requires it

Symbiont is built for that layer.

Optional [governed improvements](docs/governed-improvements.md) let operators
evaluate versioned workflow instructions against signed trial evidence, approve
an exact candidate and pin it for explicitly selected runs. Existing agents do
not opt in automatically. The OSS lifecycle includes offline evaluation, rollback
and independently verifiable exports; organization-wide release management is
separate from these runtime controls.

### Open Agent Trust Stack (OATS) — reference implementation

Symbiont is the **reference implementation of the [Open Agent Trust Stack (OATS)](https://openagenttruststack.org)** — an open specification (CC BY 4.0) for securing AI agent execution through structural enforcement rather than post-hoc interception ("define what is permitted and make everything else structurally inexpressible"). The OATS spec is grounded in Symbiont's production operational experience and Symbiont's design tracks the OATS layers directly:

| OATS Layer | Symbiont mapping |
|---|---|
| **Layer 1 — ORGA Loop** (typestate-enforced Observe-Reason-Gate-Act) | `crates/runtime/src/reasoning/` — typestate-enforced phases; policy gate is unskippable at compile time. See [Wanger 2026 / DOI 10.5281/zenodo.19896446](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19896446). |
| **Layer 2 — Tool Contracts** | [ToolClad](https://github.com/ThirdKeyAI/ToolClad) declarative `.clad.toml` manifests + the `agent_summary` typestate fence in `crates/runtime/src/toolclad/`. See [Wanger 2026 / DOI 10.5281/zenodo.19957596](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19957596). |
| **Layer 3 — Identity** | [SchemaPin](https://github.com/ThirdKeyAI/SchemaPin) for MCP tools + [AgentPin](https://github.com/ThirdKeyAI/AgentPin) ES256 domain-anchored agent identity. |
| **Layer 4 — Policy Engine** | Cedar policy gate (`crates/runtime/src/reasoning/cedar_gate.rs`) + `CommunicationPolicyGate` for inter-agent calls; both fail-closed by default since v1.14.0. |
| **Layer 5 — Audit Journal** | Required protected, hash-chained, Ed25519-signed journals for ordinary/managed CLI, HTTP, scheduled ORGA and default DSL `reason()`/`tool_call()` runs; other default paths still need migration. See [run audit](docs/run-audit.md). |

Symbiont conforms to **OATS Extended** (C1–C7 + E1–E8). The empirical comparison of structural-enforcement runtimes that informs the spec is [Wanger 2026 / DOI 10.5281/zenodo.20043247](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20043247).

## Quick start

### Linux Landlock setup

For native isolation on a supported Linux desktop, start with:

```sh
symbi init --sandbox landlock --profile assistant --dir my-agent
cd my-agent
symbi doctor
```

This path needs Landlock ABI 6+ and a systemd user manager with cgroup v2
CPU/memory/PID delegation and `DelegateSubgroup` support. It automatically starts
supervision and checks a restricted worker's execution and cleanup, without
Docker or a manually installed service unit. See the
[Landlock supervision guide](docs/landlock-supervision.md) and [governed Linux development](docs/landlock-development.md) for configuration and the current
supported execution routes.

For guided read-only repository review with an installed Claude Code, use
`symbi init --sandbox landlock --profile dev-agent --dir review-control`. It asks
for a separate source repository, executable and Messages-compatible inference
settings, then generates the read/list/search tools and their policies. Follow
the printed `doctor` and review commands. See the
[developer onboarding guide](docs/landlock-development.md#create-the-control-project)
for noninteractive flags and prerequisites.

### See the policy gate deny a tool — one command, no setup

A Cedar `forbid` blocks a privileged tool while a safe one passes. Copy-paste this against the published image (no clone, no build):

```bash
docker run --rm --entrypoint sh ghcr.io/thirdkeyai/symbi:latest -c '
mkdir -p /tmp/p && cat > /tmp/p/policy.cedar <<EOF
forbid(principal, action == Symbi::Action::"tool_call::list_agents",   resource);
permit(principal, action == Symbi::Action::"tool_call::system_health", resource);
EOF
echo "{\"tool_name\":\"list_agents\"}"   | symbi policy evaluate --stdin --policies /tmp/p --json
echo "{\"tool_name\":\"system_health\"}" | symbi policy evaluate --stdin --policies /tmp/p --json'
```

```json
{"decision":"deny","reason":"deny policies matched: policy_0","tool":"list_agents", ...}
{"decision":"allow","reason":"allow policies matched: policy_1","tool":"system_health", ...}
```

That's the same Cedar gate the runtime wires into the live reasoning loop — exactly the denial shown in the demo above.

### Define a governed tool and dry-run it — still no API key

Tool contracts are declarative. Scaffold one, validate it, and see exactly what
would run and which Cedar action gates it — all offline:

```bash
symbi tools init greet
symbi tools validate
symbi tools test greet --arg target=example
```

```
greet                                    OK

  ✓ target (string): example → OK

  Command:   greet example
  Cedar:     Tool::Greet / execute_tool

  [dry run — command not executed]
```

Argument types, scope limits and injection checks are enforced before anything
executes, and the dry run names the Cedar action that gates the call.

### Run an agent against a local model — no cloud key

Point `OPENAI_BASE_URL` at any OpenAI-compatible server. With
[Ollama](https://ollama.com) on its default port:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=ollama
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
export CHAT_MODEL=llama3.1

symbi init --no-interact
symbi run assistant --input '{"query":"hello"}'
```

```
→ Running agent: assistant (agents/assistant.symbi)
✓ Cedar policy gate wired (1 policy file(s) loaded)
Hello from the local model.

--- 1 iterations, 2 tokens, terminated: Completed ---
```

### Install the CLI

```bash
# Linux / macOS — installs the `symbi` binary to /usr/local/bin
curl -fsSL https://symbiont.dev/install.sh | bash
symbi --help
```

The installer fetches the prebuilt release binary for your platform. Pin a version with `bash -s -- --version v1.16.0` or change the target with `--dir`. Prefer Docker or [building from source](#build-from-source)? Both are below.

Already have a Rust toolchain (1.89+)? Install from crates.io instead:

```bash
cargo install symbi
symbi --help
```

### Prerequisites

* Docker (recommended) or Rust 1.89+

### Scaffold and run a project (Docker, ~60 seconds)

```bash
# 1. Create the project in the current directory.
#    Generates symbiont.toml, agents/, policies/, docker-compose.yml, and
#    a .env with a freshly generated SYMBIONT_MASTER_KEY.
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace ghcr.io/thirdkeyai/symbi:latest \
  init --profile assistant --no-interact --dir /workspace

# 2. Start the runtime. Reads .env automatically.
docker compose up
```

That's it — Runtime API on `http://localhost:8080`, HTTP Input on `http://localhost:8081`.
Use `symbi init --catalog list` (or the Docker equivalent) to browse pre-built agents.

### Other Docker recipes

```bash
# Ad-hoc runtime without a project (ephemeral, no master key)
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 ghcr.io/thirdkeyai/symbi:latest up

# MCP server only
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/thirdkeyai/symbi:latest mcp

# Parse an agent definition (`.symbi`; legacy `.dsl` also accepted)
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace ghcr.io/thirdkeyai/symbi:latest \
  dsl -f /workspace/agent.symbi
```

### Build from source

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/symbi --help

# Scaffold a project locally, then start the runtime
./target/release/symbi init --profile assistant --no-interact
./target/release/symbi up
```

> For production deployments, review `SECURITY.md` and the [deployment guide](https://docs.symbiont.dev/getting-started) before enabling untrusted tool execution.

### Start from a template

Prefer a task-shaped starting point over a blank project? `symbi new` scaffolds
around a template:

```bash
symbi new --list                     # webhook-min, webscraper-agent, slm-first, rag-lite
symbi new <template> <project-name>
```

### Agent fleet (symbi-shell)

`symbi shell` auto-loads agents from `./agents` on startup — TOML manifests with
`name` / `description` / `system_prompt` / optional `tools`. Talk to the
orchestrator in natural language; it delegates sub-tasks to the right agent
through the governed communication path (every delegation is policy-checked and
audited). Manage the fleet with `/agents list`, `/agents load <dir>`, and
`/agents reload`. `.symbi` and legacy `.dsl` declarations can register conversational fleet agents.
Explicit sandbox declarations remain refused pending canonical per-agent boundary
binding; this fleet surface does not execute their behavior steps.

You can also address one agent directly: `@<name> <message>` holds a governed,
multi-turn conversation with that agent (its own thread, separate from the
orchestrator), or `/agent use <name>` focuses the prompt on it until
`/agent clear`. The footer shows the current addressee (`→ ORCH` or `→ @name`).
Direct messages are policy-checked and audited exactly like orchestrator-routed
delegation.

The orchestrator also has governed tools: read-only `read_file` / `search`
(relative to explicit `/workspace` data mounts), and mutating `edit_file`,
`save_artifact` plus an optional `shell`. File and command effects use the selected
Docker/gVisor worker; each turn requires protected signed audit.
Mutating tools require **human approval** — each call is held in the Gate panel
(`Ctrl+G` opens the queue, Enter reviews the complete request, then `a` approves
or `d` denies; the held action fails closed on expiry). `shell`
(arbitrary command execution) is **off by default** and only available when the
shell is started with `--allow-shell`. `--yes` does not bypass runtime approval.
See [workspace setup and audit UX](docs/shell-containment.md).

## How it works

Symbiont separates agent intent from execution authority:

1. **Agents propose** actions through the reasoning loop (Observe-Reason-Gate-Act)
2. **The runtime evaluates** each action against policy, identity, and trust checks
3. **Policy decides** — allowed actions execute; denied actions are blocked or routed for approval
4. **Everything is logged** — tamper-evident audit trail for every decision

Model output is never treated as execution authority. The runtime controls what actually happens.

### Example: untrusted tool blocked by policy

An agent attempts to call an unverified MCP tool. The runtime:

1. Checks SchemaPin verification status — tool signature is missing or invalid
2. Evaluates Cedar policy — `forbid(action == Action::"tool_call") when { !resource.verified }`
3. Blocks execution and logs the denial with full context
4. Optionally routes to an operator for manual approval

No code change required. The policy governs execution.

## DSL example

```symbiont
metadata {
    version = "1.0.0"
    description = "Validate a dataset and return a quality report"
}

agent data_validator(data: DataSet) -> ValidationReport {
    capabilities = ["data_validation", "schema_checking"]

    policy data_quality {
        allow: ["read_data", "validate_schema"]
            if data.source.trusted == true
        deny: ["write_data", "network_access"]

        require: {
            input_sanitization: true
        }

        audit: {
            log_level: "info",
            include_statistics: true
        }
    }

    with memory = "ephemeral", privacy = "high", sandbox = "Tier1" {
        return validate(data);
    }
}
```

See the [DSL guide](https://docs.symbiont.dev/dsl-guide) for the full grammar including `metadata`, `schedule`, `webhook`, and `channel` blocks.

> **File extension:** Symbiont agent definitions use `.symbi` as their canonical extension (e.g. `agents/assistant.symbi`). The legacy `.dsl` extension continues to be parsed indefinitely for backward compatibility, but new projects scaffolded with `symbi init` and all examples in this repo use `.symbi`.

---

## Security model

Symbiont is designed around a simple principle: **model output should never be trusted as execution authority.**

Actions flow through runtime controls:

* **Zero trust** — all agent inputs are untrusted by default
* **Policy checks** — Cedar authorization before every tool call and resource access
* **Tool verification** — SchemaPin cryptographic verification of tool schemas
* **Sandbox boundaries** — pick the isolation level per agent: Docker (default), gVisor (`runsc` syscall filter), or Firecracker (microVM)
* **Operator approval** — human review gates for sensitive actions
* **Secrets control** — Vault/OpenBao backends, encrypted local storage, agent namespaces
* **Audit logging** — cryptographically tamper-evident records of every decision

If you are executing untrusted code or risky tools, do not rely on a weak local execution model as your only boundary. See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) and the [security model docs](https://docs.symbiont.dev/security-model).

## SDKs

Official client SDKs for integrating with the Symbiont runtime from your application:

| Language | Package | Repository |
|----------|---------|------------|
| **JavaScript/TypeScript** | [symbiont-sdk-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/symbiont-sdk-js) | [GitHub](https://github.com/ThirdKeyAI/symbiont-sdk-js) |
| **Python** | [symbiont-sdk](https://pypi.org/project/symbiont-sdk/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/ThirdKeyAI/symbiont-sdk-python) |

> **Production recommendation:** The JS and Python SDKs are HTTP clients intended for application integration and prototyping. For production agent workloads, we recommend building directly on the **Rust implementation** to leverage Symbiont's full typestate-driven safety guarantees — capability authorization, policy enforcement, and lifecycle invariants enforced at compile time rather than runtime. Dynamic-language clients can only verify these properties after a request crosses the runtime boundary.
