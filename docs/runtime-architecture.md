# Runtime Architecture

Understanding the Symbi runtime system architecture and core components.



---

## Overview

The Symbi runtime system provides a secure, scalable, and policy-aware execution environment for autonomous agents. Built on Rust for performance and safety, it implements a multi-tier security model with comprehensive audit capabilities.

### Core Principles

- **Security by Default**: Every operation is subject to policy enforcement
- **Zero Trust**: All components and communications are verified
- **Complete Auditability**: Every action is logged with cryptographic integrity
- **Policy-Driven**: Declarative policies control all system behavior
- **High Performance**: Rust-native implementation for production workloads

## Core Components

### Agent Runtime Scheduler

The central orchestrator responsible for managing agent execution with real task execution and graceful shutdown capabilities.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- **Task Scheduling**: Priority-based scheduling with resource awareness
- **Real Task Execution**: Actual process spawning and monitoring with comprehensive metrics
- **Load Balancing**: Distribution across available resources
- **Resource Allocation**: Memory, CPU, and I/O assignment
- **Policy Coordination**: Integration with policy enforcement
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Coordinated shutdown with resource cleanup

**Execution Modes:**
- **Ephemeral**: Run-once tasks that terminate after completion
- **Persistent**: Long-running agents with continuous monitoring
- **Scheduled**: Interval-based execution with automatic rescheduling
- **Event-Driven**: Triggered execution based on system events

**Performance Characteristics:**
- Support for 10,000+ logical agents in memory (concurrent sandbox executions depend on host resources and sandbox tier — Docker containers require more resources than in-process agents)
- Sub-millisecond scheduling decisions
- Priority-based preemption
- Resource-aware placement
- Real-time process monitoring and health checks
- Graceful shutdown with 30-second timeout before force termination

**Real Task Execution Features:**
- Process spawning with secure execution environments
- Resource monitoring (memory, CPU usage) every 5 seconds
- Task timeout enforcement with configurable limits
- Comprehensive execution metrics and statistics
- Process health monitoring and automatic failure detection

**Graceful Shutdown Process:**
1. **Stop New Tasks**: Prevent new agent scheduling
2. **Graceful Termination**: Attempt graceful shutdown of running agents (30s timeout)
3. **Force Termination**: Force-kill remaining processes if needed
4. **Metrics Flush**: Save performance and usage statistics
5. **Resource Cleanup**: Release allocated resources and cleanup state
6. **Queue Cleanup**: Clear pending agent queue

```rust
pub struct AgentScheduler {
    priority_queues: Vec<PriorityQueue<AgentTask>>,
    resource_pool: ResourcePool,
    policy_engine: Arc<PolicyEngine>,
    load_balancer: LoadBalancer,
    task_manager: Arc<TaskManager>,
}

impl AgentScheduler {
    pub async fn schedule_agent(&self, config: AgentConfig) -> Result<AgentId>;
    pub async fn shutdown_agent(&self, agent_id: AgentId) -> Result<()>;
    pub async fn get_system_status(&self) -> SystemStatus;
    pub async fn shutdown(&self) -> Result<()>;
}
```

### Agent Lifecycle Controller

Manages the complete lifecycle of agents from initialization to termination.

**Lifecycle States:**
1. **Initializing**: Parsing DSL and validating configuration
2. **Ready**: Waiting for task assignment
3. **Running**: Actively executing tasks
4. **Suspended**: Paused due to policy violation or resource constraints
5. **Terminated**: Gracefully shutdown or forcibly stopped

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Initializing
    Initializing --> Ready: Valid Config
    Initializing --> Failed: Invalid Config
    Ready --> Running: Task Assigned
    Running --> Suspended: Policy Violation
    Running --> Ready: Task Complete
    Suspended --> Running: Policy Cleared
    Suspended --> Terminated: Manual Override
    Ready --> Terminated: Shutdown
    Failed --> Terminated
    Terminated --> [*]
```

### Resource Management

**Resource Types Managed:**
- **Memory**: Heap allocation with limits and monitoring
- **CPU**: Core allocation and utilization tracking
- **Disk I/O**: Read/write bandwidth limits
- **Network I/O**: Bandwidth and connection limits
- **Execution Time**: Timeout enforcement

**Resource Allocation Strategies:**
- **First Fit**: Fastest allocation for low-latency scenarios
- **Best Fit**: Optimal utilization for resource efficiency
- **Priority-Based**: Guarantee resources for critical agents

```rust
pub struct ResourceLimits {
    pub memory_mb: usize,
    pub cpu_cores: f32,
    pub disk_io_mbps: usize,
    pub network_io_mbps: usize,
    pub execution_timeout: Duration,
}
```

## Multi-Tier Security

### Sandbox Architecture

The runtime implements two security tiers based on operation risk:

#### Tier 1: Docker Isolation
**Use Case**: Low-risk operations, development tasks
- Container-based isolation
- Resource limits and capability dropping
- Network isolation and read-only filesystems
- Suitable for trusted code with minimal security requirements

#### Tier 2: gVisor Isolation
**Use Case**: Standard production tasks, data processing
- User-space kernel with system call interception
- Memory protection and I/O virtualization
- Enhanced security with minimal performance impact
- Default tier for most agent operations

> **Note**: Additional isolation tiers are available in Enterprise editions for maximum security requirements.

---

## Communication System

### Message Types

The runtime supports multiple communication patterns:

**Direct Messaging**: Point-to-point communication with delivery guarantees
```rust
let response = agent_bus.send_message(
    target_agent_id, 
    SecureMessage::new(payload)
).await?;
```

**Publish-Subscribe**: Topic-based event distribution
```rust
agent_bus.publish("data_processing.completed", event_data).await?;
agent_bus.subscribe("security.alerts", alert_handler).await?;
```

**Request-Response**: Synchronous communication with timeout
```rust
let result = agent_bus.request(
    target_agent, 
    request_payload,
    timeout_duration
).await?;
```

### Security Features

**Message Encryption**: AES-256-GCM for payload protection
**Digital Signatures**: Ed25519 signatures for authenticity
**Message Routing**: Policy-based routing controls
**Rate Limiting**: Per-agent message rate enforcement

```rust
pub struct SecureMessage {
    pub id: MessageId,
    pub sender: AgentId,
    pub recipient: Option<AgentId>,
    pub encrypted_payload: Vec<u8>,
    pub signature: Ed25519Signature,
    pub timestamp: SystemTime,
}
```

### Communication Policy Gate

The `CommunicationPolicyGate` sits between the DSL builtins and the CommunicationBus. All five inter-agent builtins (`ask`, `delegate`, `send_to`, `parallel`, `race`) are routed through it:

1. **Policy evaluation** — Cedar-style rules checked before any message is sent
2. **Message creation** — `SecureMessage` with Ed25519 signature and AES-256-GCM encryption
3. **Delivery tracking** — message status and audit trail via the CommunicationBus
4. **Response logging** — request/response pairs tracked with `RequestId` correlation

When the policy gate is not configured (e.g., standalone REPL), builtins behave identically to their original implementation — no policy check, no message tracking. This preserves backward compatibility.

The `ReasoningBuiltinContext` carries three optional fields:
- `sender_agent_id` — identity of the calling agent
- `comm_bus` — reference to the CommunicationBus for message routing
- `comm_policy` — reference to the CommunicationPolicyGate for authorization

## Context & Knowledge Systems

### Agent Context Manager

Provides sophisticated persistent memory and knowledge management for agents with comprehensive search capabilities and access control.

**Context Types:**
- **Short-term Memory**: Recent interactions and immediate context
- **Long-term Memory**: Persistent knowledge and learned patterns
- **Working Memory**: Active processing and temporary state
- **Episodic Memory**: Structured experiences with events and outcomes
- **Semantic Memory**: Concepts, relationships, and structured knowledge
- **Shared Knowledge**: Cross-agent knowledge sharing with access control

**Advanced Search Modes:**
- **Keyword Search**: Text-based search with relevance scoring
- **Temporal Search**: Time-range based queries with recency factors
- **Similarity Search**: Vector-based semantic similarity using embeddings
- **Hybrid Search**: Combined keyword and similarity search with weighted scoring

**Access Control & Policy Integration:**
- **Policy Engine Integration**: Connected to resource access policies
- **Agent-Scoped Access**: Isolated contexts per agent with secure boundaries
- **Knowledge Sharing Controls**: Granular permissions for cross-agent knowledge access
- **Access Level Management**: Public, Restricted, Confidential, and Secret classifications

**Importance Calculation Algorithm:**
- **Multi-Factor Scoring**: Base importance, access frequency, recency, and user feedback
- **Memory Type Weighting**: Different importance multipliers per memory type
- **Age Decay**: Exponential decay with configurable half-life per memory type
- **Access Pattern Analysis**: Logarithmic scaling for frequently accessed items

**Context Archiving & Retention:**
- **Automatic Archiving**: Policy-driven archiving of old memory items
- **Retention Policies**: Configurable retention periods per data type
- **Compressed Storage**: Gzip compression for archived data
- **Incremental Cleanup**: Background cleanup with retention statistics

**Context Statistics & Monitoring:**
- **Memory Usage Tracking**: Accurate byte-level memory calculations
- **Retention Analytics**: Items eligible for archiving and deletion
- **Performance Metrics**: Context retrieval latency and throughput
- **Health Monitoring**: Context manager health checks and status

**Knowledge Search Fallback:**
- **Primary Vector Search**: Semantic search via vector database when available
- **Fallback Keyword Search**: Text-based search when vector DB unavailable
- **Relevance Scoring**: Sophisticated scoring combining multiple factors
- **Trust Score Calculation**: Trust metrics for shared knowledge items

```rust
pub trait ContextManager {
    async fn store_context(&self, agent_id: AgentId, context: AgentContext) -> Result<ContextId>;
    async fn retrieve_context(&self, agent_id: AgentId, session_id: Option<SessionId>) -> Result<Option<AgentContext>>;
    async fn query_context(&self, agent_id: AgentId, query: ContextQuery) -> Result<Vec<ContextItem>>;
    async fn update_memory(&self, agent_id: AgentId, updates: Vec<MemoryUpdate>) -> Result<()>;
    async fn search_knowledge(&self, agent_id: AgentId, query: &str, limit: usize) -> Result<Vec<KnowledgeItem>>;
    async fn share_knowledge(&self, from_agent: AgentId, to_agent: AgentId, knowledge_id: KnowledgeId, access_level: AccessLevel) -> Result<()>;
    async fn archive_context(&self, agent_id: AgentId, before: SystemTime) -> Result<u32>;
    async fn get_context_stats(&self, agent_id: AgentId) -> Result<ContextStats>;
    async fn shutdown(&self) -> Result<()>;
}
```

### RAG Engine Integration

**RAG Pipeline:**
1. **Query Analysis**: Understanding agent information needs
2. **Vector Search**: Semantic similarity search in knowledge base
3. **Document Retrieval**: Fetching relevant knowledge documents
4. **Context Ranking**: Relevance scoring and filtering
5. **Response Generation**: Context-augmented response synthesis

**Performance Targets:**
- Context retrieval: <50ms average
- Vector search: <100ms for 1M+ embeddings
- RAG pipeline: <500ms end-to-end

### Vector Database

**Supported Operations:**
- **Semantic Search**: Similarity-based document retrieval
- **Metadata Filtering**: Constraint-based search refinement
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient bulk operations
- **Real-time Updates**: Dynamic knowledge base updates

**Vector Database Abstraction:**

Symbi uses a pluggable vector database backend. **LanceDB** is the zero-config default (embedded, no external service required). **Qdrant** is available as an optional backend behind the `vector-qdrant` feature flag.

| Backend | Feature Flag | Config Required | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| LanceDB (default) | _built-in_ | None (zero-config) | Development, single-node, embedded deployments |
| Qdrant | `vector-qdrant` | `SYMBIONT_VECTOR_HOST` | Distributed production clusters |

```rust
pub struct VectorConfig {
    pub backend: VectorBackend,       // LanceDB (default) or Qdrant
    pub dimension: usize,             // 1536 for OpenAI embeddings
    pub distance_metric: DistanceMetric::Cosine,
    pub index_type: IndexType::HNSW,
    pub data_path: PathBuf,           // LanceDB storage path
}
```

## Agentic Reasoning Loop

The reasoning loop implements an **Observe-Reason-Gate-Act (ORGA)** cycle that drives autonomous agent behavior. It unifies LLM inference, policy enforcement, tool execution, and knowledge management into a single, type-safe loop.

For a complete guide, see the [Reasoning Loop Guide](reasoning-loop.md).

### Architecture Overview

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "ORGA Cycle"
        R[Reasoning\nLLM Inference] --> P[Policy Check\nGate Evaluation]
        P --> D[Tool Dispatching\nAction Execution]

        O --> R
    end

    subgraph "Knowledge Bridge"
        KB[Knowledge\nContext Manager]
        KT[recall_knowledge\nstore_knowledge]
    end

    subgraph "Infrastructure"
        CB[Circuit Breakers]
        J[Durable Journal]
        M[Metrics and Tracing]
    end

    KB -->|inject context| R
    KT -->|tool calls| D
    CB --> D
    J --> R
    J --> P
    J --> D
    M --> R
```

### Typestate-Enforced Phase Transitions

Phase transitions are enforced at compile time using zero-sized type markers. Invalid transitions (e.g., dispatching tools without reasoning first) are structurally impossible:

```
AgentLoop<Reasoning> → AgentLoop<PolicyCheck> → AgentLoop<ToolDispatching> → AgentLoop<Observing>
         ↑                                                                          │
         └──────────────────────── LoopContinuation::Continue ──────────────────────┘
```

Each phase consumes `self` and produces the next phase, making skipping phases a compile error.

### ReasoningLoopRunner

The main entry point wires together all components:

```rust
pub struct ReasoningLoopRunner {
    pub provider: Arc<dyn InferenceProvider>,      // Cloud or SLM inference
    pub policy_gate: Arc<dyn ReasoningPolicyGate>, // Action evaluation
    pub executor: Arc<dyn ActionExecutor>,          // Tool dispatch
    pub context_manager: Arc<dyn ContextManager>,   // Token budget
    pub circuit_breakers: Arc<CircuitBreakerRegistry>,
    pub journal: Arc<dyn JournalWriter>,            // Durable event log
    pub knowledge_bridge: Option<Arc<KnowledgeBridge>>, // Optional knowledge integration
}
```

### Knowledge-Reasoning Bridge

When a `KnowledgeBridge` is provided, the reasoning loop gains access to the agent's knowledge store:

- **Before each reasoning step**: Relevant knowledge is retrieved and injected as a system message
- **During tool dispatch**: `recall_knowledge` and `store_knowledge` tool calls are intercepted by `KnowledgeAwareExecutor`
- **After loop completion**: Conversation learnings are persisted as episodic memory

The bridge is fully opt-in — without it, the loop behaves identically to before.

### Loop Phases

| Phase | Module | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Reasoning** | `phases.rs` | LLM inference produces proposed actions (tool calls or text response) |
| **Policy Check** | `policy_bridge.rs` | Each action evaluated: Allow, Deny, or Modify |
| **Tool Dispatching** | `executor.rs` | Approved actions executed in parallel with circuit breakers |
| **Observing** | `phases.rs` | Results collected, loop continues or terminates |

### Supporting Infrastructure

| Saga Pattern | `saga.rs` | Multi-step distributed operations with checkpoint/rollback |
| Agent Registry | `agent_registry.rs` | Persistent agent metadata with lifecycle management |
| Tracing | `tracing_spans.rs` | OpenTelemetry distributed tracing for each loop phase |
| Metrics | `metrics.rs` | Iteration counts, token usage, latency histograms |

    policy_engine: Arc<PolicyEngine>,
    audit_logger: AuditLogger,
}

impl ToolVerifier {
    pub async fn verify_tool(&self, tool: &MCPTool) -> VerificationResult;
    pub async fn enforce_policies(&self, agent_id: AgentId, tool: &MCPTool) -> PolicyResult;
}
```

---

## Policy Enforcement

### Policy Engine Architecture

**Policy Types:**
- **Access Control**: Who can access what resources
- **Data Flow**: How data moves through the system
- **Resource Usage**: Limits on computational resources
- **Audit Requirements**: What must be logged and how

**Policy Evaluation:**
```rust
pub enum PolicyDecision {
    Allow,
    Deny { reason: String },
    AllowWithConditions { conditions: Vec<PolicyCondition> },
}

pub trait PolicyEngine {
    async fn evaluate_policy(&self, context: PolicyContext, action: Action) -> PolicyDecision;
    async fn register_policy(&self, policy: Policy) -> Result<PolicyId>;
}
```

### Real-time Enforcement

**Enforcement Points:**
- Agent creation and configuration
- Message sending and routing
- Resource allocation requests
- External tool invocation
- Data access operations

**Performance:**
- Policy evaluation: <1ms per decision
- Batch evaluation: 10,000+ decisions per second
- Real-time updates: Policy changes propagated instantly

---

## Audit and Compliance

### Cryptographic Audit Trail

**Audit Event Structure:**
```rust
pub struct AuditEvent {
    pub event_id: Uuid,
    pub timestamp: SystemTime,
    pub agent_id: AgentId,
    pub event_type: AuditEventType,
    pub details: AuditDetails,
    pub signature: Ed25519Signature,
    pub chain_hash: Hash,
}
```

**Integrity Guarantees:**
- **Digital Signatures**: Ed25519 signatures on all events
- **Hash Chaining**: Events linked in immutable chain
- **Timestamp Verification**: Cryptographic timestamps
- **Batch Verification**: Efficient bulk verification

### Compliance Features

**Regulatory Support:**
