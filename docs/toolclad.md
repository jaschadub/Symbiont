# ToolClad — Declarative Tool Contracts

ToolClad provides declarative tool contracts for the Symbiont runtime. Define what a tool does, what arguments it accepts, and how it executes — in a single `.clad.toml` manifest. The runtime handles argument validation, scope enforcement, secret injection, Cedar policy generation, and evidence capture.

## Why ToolClad

External tools (nmap, curl, whois, custom scripts) are useful but dangerous. Passing raw arguments to shell commands creates injection risk. Trusting tool output without validation creates integrity risk. ToolClad solves this by putting a contract between the agent and the tool.

The contract defines:
- **What arguments the tool accepts** — typed, validated, injection-checked
- **How the tool executes** — shell command, HTTP API, MCP proxy, interactive session, or browser
- **What scope the tool operates in** — target restrictions, domain allowlists
- **What policies govern it** — Cedar authorization, human approval gates
- **What output the tool produces** — format, schema validation, evidence envelope

## Quick start

### Create a tool manifest

```bash
symbi tools init my_tool
```

This creates `tools/my_tool.clad.toml` with a starter template.

### Validate and test

```bash
# Validate all manifests
symbi tools validate

# Validate a specific manifest
symbi tools validate tools/my_tool.clad.toml

# Dry-run with arguments (validates without executing)
symbi tools test my_tool --arg target=10.0.1.5

# View the MCP schema generated for a tool
symbi tools schema my_tool

# List all discovered tools
symbi tools list
```

### Use in the runtime

Tools in the `tools/` directory are automatically discovered and exposed to the reasoning loop as MCP-compatible tool definitions. Agents can call them like any other tool — the runtime handles validation, execution, and evidence capture.

---

## Manifest format

A `.clad.toml` file has up to 9 sections:

### [tool] — Metadata

```toml
[tool]
name = "nmap_scan"
version = "1.0.0"
binary = "nmap"
description = "Network port scanner"
mode = "oneshot"          # oneshot | session | browser
timeout_seconds = 60
risk_tier = "medium"      # low | medium | high
human_approval = false    # require operator approval before execution

[tool.cedar]
resource = "Tool::NmapScan"
action = "execute_tool"

[tool.evidence]
output_dir = "evidence/{_scan_id}"
capture = true
hash = "sha256"
```

### [args.*] — Argument definitions

Each argument has a type, validation rules, and metadata:

```toml
[args.target]
position = 1
type = "scope_target"     # validated against project scope
required = true
description = "Target IP, CIDR, or hostname"
scope_check = true        # enforce scope boundaries

[args.scan_type]
position = 2
type = "enum"
allowed = ["quick", "full", "stealth", "ping"]
default = "quick"
description = "Scan profile"

[args.max_rate]
position = 3
type = "integer"
min = 1
max = 10000
default = "1000"
description = "Maximum packets per second"
```

**Built-in argument types:**

| Type | Validation |
|------|-----------|
| `string` | Non-empty, no shell metacharacters, optional regex pattern |
| `integer` | i64 with optional min/max/clamp |
| `port` | 1–65535 |
| `boolean` | "true" or "false" |
| `enum` | Must match one of the `allowed` values |
| `scope_target` | IP, CIDR, or hostname — validated against project scope |
| `url` | Must contain "://", optional scheme whitelist |
| `path` | Relative path; rejects absolute/rooted paths and `..` components; preserves the validated spelling |
| `ip_address` | Valid IPv4 or IPv6 |
| `cidr` | Valid CIDR notation with prefix validation |
| `credential_file` | Relative path that must name an existing regular file on the controller |
| `duration` | Integer with suffix (s/m/h), converted to seconds |
| `literal_text` | Explicit bounded UTF-8 content (32 KiB), preserving whitespace and metacharacters; rejects NUL. Use with a pre-tokenized argv contract. An interpreter such as `sh -c` deliberately treats it as code and requires the appropriate policy, sandbox and approval. |
| `regex_match` | Custom regex from the `pattern` field |
| `agent_summary` | Free text bound for a downstream agent's prompt — strips invisible Unicode and renderer-hidden markup, rejects known injection markers. Best-effort defense-in-depth, **not** a load-bearing control (see [Typed + grounded decisions](#typed-grounded-decisions)) |

`string` rejects shell metacharacters; the explicit `literal_text` type preserves them as data: `;` `|` `&` `$` `` ` `` `(` `)` `{` `}` `[` `]` `<` `>` `!` `\n` `\r` `\0`

Path validation is lexical and portable across `/` and `\` separators. It does
not canonicalize against the controller filesystem: a relative path remains
relative to the selected worker's working directory. Ordinary dotted filenames
such as `report..csv` remain valid. Absolute paths previously accepted by this
embedded validator are now rejected, matching ToolClad's relative-path contract.
For intentional absolute argv data, declare `literal_text` explicitly and apply
the appropriate policy and sandbox restrictions.

`credential_file` adds a controller-side regular-file preflight and preserves the
relative argument. It follows filesystem links and does not prove that a file
exists or is confined in the worker. Mounts, working directory and the selected
sandbox define the worker's filesystem authority; path syntax alone does not
prevent a tool from following symlinks within that authority.

**Optional argument flags:**

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `scope_check = true` | Validate the value against the project scope (IP/CIDR/hostname args) |
| `feeds_decision = true` | This argument's value feeds a privileged downstream decision (routing, escalation, authorization). Free-text types (`string`, `literal_text`, `agent_summary`, `regex_match`) marked this way are flagged as an anti-pattern by ToolClad manifest validation — use an `enum` plus Cedar grounding instead (see [Typed + grounded decisions](#typed-grounded-decisions)) |

**Custom types** can be defined in a project-level `toolclad.toml`:

```toml
[types.service_protocol]
base = "enum"
allowed = ["ssh", "ftp", "http"]
description = "Network service protocol"
```

### [command] — Command construction

The command section defines how to build the shell command from validated arguments:

```toml
[command]
template = "nmap {_scan_flags} --max-rate {max_rate} -oX - {target}"

[command.defaults]
max_rate = 1000

[command.mappings.scan_type]
quick = "-sV --top-ports 100"
full = "-sV -sC -p-"
stealth = "-sS -T2"
ping = "-sn -PE"

[command.conditionals.verbose_flags]
when = "verbose != ''"
template = "-v{verbose}"
```

Templates use `{arg_name}` placeholders. The runtime interpolates validated arguments and executes via direct argv (no shell invocation) to prevent injection.

### [output] — Output configuration

```toml
[output]
format = "xml"            # json | xml | csv | jsonl | text
parser = "builtin:xml"    # or path to custom parser binary
envelope = true           # wrap in evidence envelope

[output.schema]
type = "object"
properties.hosts.type = "array"
```

Schema validation produces warnings (non-blocking) when output doesn't match the expected structure.

---

## Execution modes

### Oneshot (default)

Single execution with a fixed timeout. Three backend options:

**Shell backend** — build and execute a command:
```toml
[tool]
mode = "oneshot"
binary = "nmap"

[command]
template = "nmap {target}"
```

**HTTP backend** — make an HTTP request:
```toml
[tool]
mode = "oneshot"

[http]
method = "GET"
url = "https://api.example.com/lookup?q={target}"
headers = { Authorization = "Bearer {_secret:api_key}" }
success_status = [200]
```

HTTP requests include SSRF protection — private IP ranges, localhost, and cloud metadata endpoints are blocked.

**MCP proxy backend** — governed passthrough to an upstream MCP tool:
```toml
[tool]
mode = "oneshot"

[mcp]
server = "upstream_server"
tool = "raw_tool_name"

[mcp.field_map]
target = "host"
scan_type = "mode"
```

### Session (interactive CLI)

Spawns a real pseudo-terminal inside the selected Docker/gVisor container and maintains state across commands in one governed run. Requires `toolclad-session`, enabled in the default CLI. See [terminal boundaries and SDK lifecycle](interactive-terminal-boundary.md) for image requirements, limits and cleanup.

```toml
[tool]
mode = "session"
binary = "msfconsole"

[session]
startup_command = "msfconsole -q"
ready_pattern = "msf6\\s*>"
startup_timeout_seconds = 30
idle_timeout_seconds = 300
max_interactions = 50

[session.commands.run]
pattern = "help"
description = "Show command help"
risk_tier = "low"
human_approval = false
```

Each declared command becomes a separate MCP tool definition (e.g., `msfconsole.run`).

### Browser (CDP)

> **Status: not yet executable.** Browser (`mode = "browser"`) tools are parsed,
> argument-validated, and scope-checked, but Chrome DevTools Protocol execution
> is not implemented yet. It is gated behind the `toolclad-browser` cargo feature,
> whose real backend is still pending — until then a browser command returns an
> honest error, never a fabricated result. Private transport fixtures can drive
> contained Chromium, but they do not enable the public browser executor.

The manifest describes the intended Chrome DevTools Protocol interface.
Neither `connect = "launch"` nor live attachment starts a browser today.

```toml
[tool]
mode = "browser"

[browser]
engine = "cdp"
headless = true
connect = "launch"
extract_mode = "accessibility_tree"

[browser.scope]
allowed_domains = ["example.com", "*.test.example.com"]
blocked_domains = ["admin.example.com"]
allow_external = false

[browser.network]
allowed_methods = ["GET", "HEAD"]
private_origins = []

[browser.commands.navigate]
description = "Navigate to URL"
```

Planned browser commands: `navigate`, `snapshot`, `click`, `type_text`, `submit_form`, `extract`, `screenshot`, `execute_js`, `wait_for`, `go_back`, `list_tabs`, `network_timing`.

---

## Scope enforcement

ToolClad enforces target scope to prevent agents from operating outside authorized boundaries.

### Project scope

Define allowed targets in `scope/scope.toml`:

```toml
[scope]
targets = ["10.0.1.0/24", "192.168.1.0/24"]
domains = ["example.com", "*.test.example.com"]
exclude = ["10.0.1.1"]
```

Arguments with `scope_check = true` are validated against this scope. IPs are checked against CIDR ranges, hostnames against domain patterns (with wildcard suffix matching).

### URL scope (browser mode)

Navigation requires `[browser.scope]` and an HTTP(S) URL without embedded
credentials. Domain comparisons use canonical hostnames, including case,
internationalized names, encoded host characters and a final DNS dot. Blocked
rules take precedence; `*.example.com` matches the base domain and its
subdomains. Malformed rules fail closed, including when `allow_external = true`.
At most 256 domain rules and an 8 KiB URL are accepted. Control characters,
backslashes and ambiguous URL forms are rejected.

Prepared navigation binds the normalized URL before policy, approval and audit.
Its prepared context also includes the effective `[browser.network]` settings;
the manifest digest binds these capabilities through authorization. GET and HEAD
are the default methods. Other supported methods (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE and
OPTIONS) require explicit inclusion; CONNECT and TRACE are refused.

Domain scope does not grant access to private addresses. An operator can grant an
exact literal origin, such as `private_origins = ["http://127.0.0.1:8080"]`, and
also include its address in `allowed_domains`. The scheme, address and effective
port must match. The exception accepts loopback, RFC1918 and IPv6 unique-local
addresses, excluding the AWS IPv6 metadata endpoint. DNS names, link-local,
multicast, unspecified and mapped IPv6 addresses cannot use it. A redirect to
another port or origin needs its own grant. Blocked domain rules still win.

The reusable `browser_network::BrowserNetworkPolicy` builds scoped requests from
CDP interception events. It removes authority/framing and hop-by-hop headers,
requires complete bounded request bodies, and refuses multipart/file uploads.
Requests are limited to 2 MiB of application data, responses to 4 MiB, and headers
to 128 entries / 64 KiB. The broker client uses DNS filtering, no ambient proxy,
no redirect following and no automatic content decompression. Responses preserve
duplicate cookies and binary header values for CDP fulfillment. Chromium receives
redirect responses and each resulting request must be checked again.

These request-construction helpers do not issue execution authority. A trusted
driver must retain the worker, mediate every target and use the call-bound journal
before sending each unchanged request. The public browser route stays unavailable
while that production driver and browser lifetime ownership are integrated.
The [contained Chromium transport fixtures](../crates/runtime/tests/fixtures/browser/README.md)
include a real local HTTP case with pre-connection signed audit, an exact POST
effect, denied method/subresource/redirect destinations and worker removal.
This is component integration evidence, not a shipping browser-command E2E.

### SSRF protection (HTTP backend)

HTTP backend requests automatically block:
- Localhost (`127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `localhost`)
- Cloud metadata (`169.254.169.254`, `metadata.google.internal`)
- Shared address space (`100.64.0.0/10`), including `100.100.100.200`, in both URL checks and DNS answers
- Private IP ranges (RFC 1918, link-local, broadcast)
- Non-HTTP/HTTPS schemes

HTTP exchange uses asynchronous I/O, a bounded request and response body, and the
remaining call deadline. Automatic redirects and ambient proxies stay disabled.
Preparation resolves the method and canonical destination before policy and
approval, including path segments that the HTTP client would normalize. URL
userinfo credentials are rejected; use explicit headers. URLs are limited to
8 KiB without control characters.
Governed calls record the built request before connecting and record the actual
response or incomplete outcome through their existing protected journal. See
[request audit records](run-audit.md). No new approval or UI control is required.

---

## Secret injection

Secrets are injected into HTTP URLs, headers, and body templates using the `{_secret:NAME}` syntax:

```toml
[http]
url = "https://api.shodan.io/shodan/host/{target}?key={_secret:shodan_key}"
```

The runtime resolves `{_secret:shodan_key}` from the environment variable `TOOLCLAD_SECRET_SHODAN_KEY`. Missing secrets produce an error before execution.

---

## Cedar policy generation

ToolClad auto-generates Cedar policies from manifest metadata:

```bash
symbi tools schema my_tool  # includes Cedar policy suggestion
```

Generated policies vary by risk tier:

**Low-risk tool:**
```cedar
permit (principal, action == Tool::WhoisLookup::Action::"execute_tool", resource)
when { resource.tool_name == "whois_lookup" };
```

**High-risk tool with human approval:**
```cedar
permit (principal, action == Tool::Exploit::Action::"execute_tool", resource)
when { resource.tool_name == "exploit" && context.has_human_approval == true };
```

---

## Evidence envelope

All tool executions are wrapped in a structured evidence envelope:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "scan_id": "1712073600-a1b2c3d4",
  "tool": "nmap_scan",
  "command": "nmap -sV --top-ports 100 --max-rate 1000 -oX - 10.0.1.5",
  "duration_ms": 4523,
  "timestamp": "2026-04-02T18:00:00Z",
  "output_hash": "sha256:a1b2c3...",
  "exit_code": 0,
  "stderr": "",
  "results": { "hosts": [...] },
  "schema_warnings": []
}
```

HTTP backend envelopes include `http_method`, `http_url`, `http_status`. MCP proxy envelopes include `mcp_server`, `mcp_tool`, `status: "delegated"`. Session and browser envelopes include `session_id`, `interaction_count`, and a transcript with timestamps.

---

## Hot-reload (development)

In development mode, ToolClad watches the `tools/` directory for changes:

- New `.clad.toml` files are discovered automatically
- Modified manifests are reloaded on save
- Deleted manifests are removed from the registry
- Parse errors produce warnings without crashing the runtime

The executor also checks manifest version at execution time — if a manifest was reloaded between planning and execution, the call is rejected to prevent plan drift.

---

## Built-in manifests

Symbiont ships with four example manifests in `tools/`:

| Manifest | Description | Mode |
|----------|-------------|------|
| `whois_lookup.clad.toml` | WHOIS domain/IP lookup | Oneshot (shell) |
| `dig_lookup.clad.toml` | DNS record lookup | Oneshot (shell) |
| `curl_fetch.clad.toml` | HTTP request with scope enforcement | Oneshot (shell) |
| `nmap_scan.clad.toml` | Network port scanner with evidence capture | Oneshot (shell) |
| `submit_triage.clad.toml` | Typed + grounded triage decision (reference) | Reference (typed decision) |

These serve as reference implementations for writing your own manifests.

---

## Typed + grounded decisions

When one agent's output drives a **privileged downstream decision** — routing, escalation, or tool authorization — that decision must not be made over the upstream agent's free text. A free-text "summary" spliced into a downstream prompt is an injection surface: a held-out red-team evaluation showed the `agent_summary` marker fence reduces orchestrator-injection escape only from ~28% to ~26% (it does not generalize to novel paraphrases), while moving the decision onto typed fields grounded in trusted context reaches 0%.

The pattern that holds:

1. **Type the decision.** The upstream agent emits an `enum`-constrained decision (e.g. `category`, `severity`), never a free-text instruction. Enum validation makes paraphrase injection structurally inert — there is no instruction channel.
2. **Ground it in trusted context.** Derive the authoritative facts from trusted input (e.g. severity inferred from the ticket the system received, not from the agent's self-report), and make the decision a [Cedar policy](/security-model) over that trusted context. The lower-trust agent's output is advisory, not authoritative.
3. **Keep `agent_summary` as defense-in-depth only.** It still strips invisible Unicode / hidden markup and logs injection-shaped attempts, but it is never the load-bearing control for a privileged decision.

Mark any argument that feeds such a decision with `feeds_decision = true`. ToolClad manifest validation flags free-text decision inputs (`string`, `literal_text`, `agent_summary`, `regex_match`) as an anti-pattern, steering authors to an `enum` plus Cedar grounding.

Reference implementation:

- `tools/submit_triage.clad.toml` — typed `category`/`severity` enums (`feeds_decision = true`), advisory-only `rationale`
- `examples/policies/triage_routing.cedar` — grounded escalation policy (`permit … when { context.ticket_severity == "critical" }`)
- `crates/runtime/src/toolclad/decision.rs` — the Rust derives-facts / Cedar-decides reference (`route_grounded`, `decide_route`)

---

## Integration with the reasoning loop

ToolClad tools are exposed to the [reasoning loop](/reasoning-loop) as MCP-compatible tool definitions. The flow:

1. **Discovery** — manifests in `tools/` are loaded at startup
2. **Schema generation** — each tool (or session/browser command) becomes a ToolDefinition with JSON Schema
3. **Tool profile filtering** — the ORGA loop's tool curator filters available tools based on glob patterns, max count, and `require_verified` flags
4. **Proposal** — the LLM proposes a tool call with arguments
5. **Policy gate** — [Cedar policy](/security-model) evaluates whether the call is allowed
6. **Validation** — ToolClad validates arguments against the manifest (types, ranges, scope, injection checks)
7. **Execution** — the runtime executes via the appropriate backend (shell argv, HTTP, MCP proxy, session, browser)
8. **Evidence** — output is parsed, schema-validated, and wrapped in an evidence envelope
9. **Observation** — the result is returned to the reasoning loop as an Observation

The policy gate and argument validation happen before execution. A failed policy check or invalid argument blocks the tool call entirely.

## Which surfaces execute tools

Not every entry point runs ToolClad tools. Knowing which do is the difference between a policy that governs real execution and one that governs nothing:

| Surface | Executes ToolClad/MCP tools | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `symbi run <agent>` | Yes | Loads `tools/` at startup |
| DSL reasoning builtins | Yes | Same loader, invoked from `.symbi` programs |
| `symbi tools test` | Yes | Single manifest, for validating one tool |
| HTTP input server | Yes, when `tools/` exists and holds at least one manifest | Otherwise starts with no executor and every tool call is refused |
| `symbi up` chat coordinator | **No** | Has no ToolClad executor at all |
| `symbi shell` (ORCH) | No | Ships its own fixed tool set — `read_file`, `search`, `edit_file`, `save_artifact` — which are not ToolClad manifests |

The chat coordinator is deliberately monitoring-only: it answers questions about a running fleet and cannot act on it. A Cedar `permit` for `tool_call::<name>` has no effect there, because no tool call is ever proposed.

This matters when writing policy. Policies sitting flat in `policies/*.cedar` are loaded by **every** surface's gate. A permit written for `symbi run` reaches the coordinator's gate too — harmless while the coordinator executes nothing, but it becomes a real grant the moment a surface gains an executor. Put surface-specific grants in `policies/<surface>/` instead, which only the named surface reads. The surface names are `run`, `coordinator`, `http-input`, `managed-cli`, `eval`, and `shell`.

If you want the coordinator to execute tools later, scope it per tool rather than switching it on globally — otherwise every permit already written for another surface applies to chat on day one.
