## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards

**Rust Code Style:**
- Use `rustfmt` for consistent formatting
- Follow Rust naming conventions
- Write idiomatic Rust code
- Include comprehensive documentation
- Add unit tests for all new functionality

**Security Requirements:**
- All security-related code must be reviewed
- Cryptographic operations must use approved libraries
- Input validation is required for all public APIs
- Security tests must accompany security features

**Performance Guidelines:**
- Benchmark performance-critical code
- Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths
- Use `async`/`await` for I/O operations
- Profile memory usage for resource-intensive features

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Types

**Unit Tests:**
- Test individual functions and modules
- Mock external dependencies
- Fast execution (<1s per test)

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_policy_evaluation() {
        let policy = Policy::new("test_policy", PolicyRules::default());
        let context = PolicyContext::new();
        let result = policy.evaluate(&context);
        assert_eq!(result, PolicyDecision::Allow);
    }
}
```

**Integration Tests:**
- Test component interactions
- Use real dependencies where possible
- Moderate execution time (<10s per test)

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_agent_lifecycle() {
    let runtime = test_runtime().await;
    let agent_config = AgentConfig::default();
    
    let agent_id = runtime.create_agent(agent_config).await.unwrap();
    let status = runtime.get_agent_status(agent_id).await.unwrap();
    
    assert_eq!(status, AgentStatus::Ready);
}
```

**Security Tests:**
- Test security controls and policies
- Verify cryptographic operations
- Test attack scenarios

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_sandbox_isolation() {
    let sandbox = create_test_sandbox(SecurityTier::Tier2).await;
    
    // Attempt to access restricted resource
    let result = sandbox.execute_malicious_code().await;
    
    // Should be blocked by security controls
    assert!(result.is_err());
    assert_eq!(result.unwrap_err(), SandboxError::AccessDenied);
}
```

### Test Data

**Test Fixtures:**
- Use consistent test data across tests
- Avoid hardcoded values where possible
- Clean up test data after execution

```rust
pub fn create_test_agent_config() -> AgentConfig {
    AgentConfig {
        id: AgentId::new(),
        name: "test_agent".to_string(),
        security_tier: SecurityTier::Tier1,
        memory_limit: 512 * 1024 * 1024, // 512MB
        capabilities: vec!["test".to_string()],
        policies: vec![],
        metadata: HashMap::new(),
    }
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Security Review Process

**Security-Sensitive Changes:**
All changes affecting security must undergo additional review:

- Cryptographic implementations
- Authentication and authorization
- Input validation and sanitization
- Sandbox and isolation mechanisms
- Audit and logging systems

**Security Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Threat model updated if necessary
- [ ] Security tests added
- [ ] Cryptographic libraries are approved
- [ ] Input validation is comprehensive
- [ ] Error handling doesn't leak information
- [ ] Audit logging is complete

### Vulnerability Reporting

**Responsible Disclosure:**
If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** create a public issue
2. Email security@thirdkey.ai with details
3. Provide reproduction steps if possible
4. Allow time for investigation and fix
5. Coordinate disclosure timeline

**Security Report Template:**
```
