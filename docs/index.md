# Symbiont Documentation

Policy-governed agent runtime for production. Execute AI agents and tools under explicit policy, identity, and audit controls.

## What is Symbiont?

Symbiont is a Rust-native runtime for executing AI agents and tools under explicit policy, identity, and audit controls.

Most agent frameworks focus on orchestration. Symbiont focuses on what happens when agents need to run in real environments with real risk: untrusted tools, sensitive data, approval boundaries, audit requirements, and repeatable enforcement.

### How it works

Symbiont separates agent intent from execution authority:

1. **Agents propose** actions through the reasoning loop (Observe-Reason-Gate-Act)
2. **The runtime evaluates** each action against policy, identity, and trust checks
3. **Policy decides** — allowed actions execute; denied actions are blocked or routed for approval
4. **Everything is logged** — tamper-evident audit trail for every decision

Model output is never treated as execution authority. The runtime controls what actually happens.

### Core capabilities

| Capability | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Policy engine** | Fine-grained [Cedar](https://www.cedarpolicy.com/) authorization for agent actions, tool calls, and resource access |
| **Tool verification** | [SchemaPin](https://schemapin.org) cryptographic verification of MCP tool schemas before execution |
| **Agent identity** | [AgentPin](https://agentpin.org) domain-anchored ES256 identity for agents and scheduled tasks |
| **Reasoning loop** | Typestate-enforced Observe-Reason-Gate-Act cycle with policy gates and circuit breakers |
| **Sandboxing** | Docker-based isolation with resource limits for untrusted workloads |
| **Audit logging** | Tamper-evident logs with structured records for every policy decision |
| **Secrets management** | Vault/OpenBao integration, AES-256-GCM encrypted storage, scoped per agent |
| **MCP integration** | Native Model Context Protocol support with governed tool access |

Additional capabilities: threat scanning for tool/skill content, cron scheduling, persistent agent memory, hybrid RAG search (LanceDB/Qdrant), webhook verification, delivery routing, OTLP telemetry, HTTP security hardening, channel adapters (Slack/Teams/Mattermost), and governance plugins for [Claude Code](https://github.com/thirdkeyai/symbi-claude-code) and [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/thirdkeyai/symbi-gemini-cli).

## Quick start

### Installation

**Install script (macOS / Linux):**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://symbiont.dev/install.sh | bash
```

**Homebrew (macOS):**
```bash
brew tap thirdkeyai/tap
brew install symbi
```

**Docker:**
```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 ghcr.io/thirdkeyai/symbi:latest up
```

**From source:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thirdkeyai/symbiont.git
cd symbiont
cargo build --release
```

Pre-built binaries are also available from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/thirdkeyai/symbiont/releases). See the [Getting Started guide](/getting-started) for full details.

### Your first agent

```symbiont
agent secure_analyst(input: DataSet) -> Result {
    policy access_control {
        allow: read(input) if input.verified == true
        deny: send_email without approval
        audit: all_operations
    }

    with memory = "persistent", requires = "approval" {
        result = analyze(input);
        return result;
    }
}
```

See the [DSL guide](/dsl-guide) for the full grammar including `metadata`, `schedule`, `webhook`, and `channel` blocks.

### Project scaffolding

```bash
symbi init        # Interactive project setup with profile templates
symbi run agent   # Run a single agent without starting the full runtime
symbi up          # Start the full runtime with auto-configuration
```

## Security model

Symbiont is designed around a simple principle: **model output should never be trusted as execution authority.**

Actions flow through runtime controls:

- **Zero trust** — all agent inputs are untrusted by default
- **Policy checks** — Cedar authorization before every tool call and resource access
- **Tool verification** — SchemaPin cryptographic verification of tool schemas
- **Sandbox boundaries** — Docker isolation for untrusted execution
- **Operator approval** — human review gates for sensitive actions
- **Secrets control** — Vault/OpenBao backends, encrypted local storage, agent namespaces
- **Audit logging** — cryptographically tamper-evident records of every decision

See the [Security Model](/security-model) guide for full details.
